# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
 The goal of the project is to review production data for insights that may help MechaCar's manufactoring team. This is done by comparing a new car prototype and compare vehicle performance of different manufacturer lots. The metrics analyzed are vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearnce, AWD capablities, MPG, and PSI. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

When looking at the entire dataset the variance level meets the 100 pounds per square inch variance limit. However considering when split into three random lots there is a large variance in lot3 that is above the 100 pound limit, there is a possibility that a third of the lot does not comply with the variance limit.

With a p-value of 0.06 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

#### Lot 1
p-value equals 1 so we fail to refject the null hypothesis

#### Lot 2
p-value equals 0.6072 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis

#### Lot 4
p-value 0.04168 so we can reject the null hypothesis.
